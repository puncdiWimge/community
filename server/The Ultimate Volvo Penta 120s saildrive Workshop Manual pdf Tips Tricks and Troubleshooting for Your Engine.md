## Benefits of the Volvo Penta 120s Saildrive
 
The Volvo Penta 120s saildrive is a compact and efficient propulsion system for sailing boats. It has several benefits over conventional shaft drives, such as:

- Reduced drag and improved performance. The saildrive eliminates the need for a long propeller shaft and a large cut-out in the hull, reducing drag and increasing speed and maneuverability.
- Lower noise and vibration. The saildrive is mounted on rubber suspension and has a flexible coupling between the engine and the drive, reducing noise and vibration transmitted to the hull and the cabin.
- Easier installation and maintenance. The saildrive is a self-contained unit that can be easily installed and removed from the boat. It also has a simple design with fewer parts and seals, making it easier to service and maintain.
- Better alignment and reliability. The saildrive has a constant and precise alignment between the engine and the propeller, eliminating the risk of misalignment and wear caused by bending or twisting of the shaft.
